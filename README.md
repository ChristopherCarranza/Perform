# Perform

Easy dependency injection for storyboard segues.

```swift
import Perform

// ...

func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: NSIndexPath) {
  let task = taskList[indexPath.row]
  perform(.showTaskDetails) { taskVC in
    taskVC.task = task
  }
}
```

## Usage

Configure your segues:

```swift
// Sources/Extensions/Segue.swift
import Perform

extension Segue {
  static var showTaskDetails: Segue<TaskDetailsViewController> {
    return .init(identifier: "ShowTaskDetails")
  }
}
```

And then use `perform(_:prepare:)` instead of `performSegue(withIdentifier:sender:)`.
That's it!

#### Type-safe segues

Perform checks the type of the destination view controller and casts it for you,
raising an error if your destination view controller is an unexpected type.

#### Still works if your view controller is embedded in a container

Ever written code like this?

```swift
guard let nav = segue.destinationViewController as? UINavigationController,
  let content = nav.rootViewController as? MyViewController
  else { return }

// ... finally! ðŸ˜­
```

Perform takes care of this, searching the view controller hierarchy for a view
controller of the matching type!

#### No switch statements in `prepareForSegue(_:sender:)`

Multiple segues from one view controller? No problem, just prepare each
destination view controller right where you perform the segue. No more massive
switch statements.
